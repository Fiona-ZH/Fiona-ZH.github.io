            <article>
              I love UX design because of its multidisciplinary and human-centered nature. It’s the marriage of my desire to solve real-life problems by empathizing with people and my passion for technology and design. For me, pursuing a career as UX designer is to connect with the world from a new perspective. It is like continuing on a trail that was always one step away from the one I’ve been on for the past years.
              <br><br>
              I could only remember by flipping through the old photo albums that the doors and lower section of the walls in our apartment were covered with my doodles and cartoon stickers. But I do remember the times when I had to wait for my mom at her workplace after school but was granted to play on a spare computer powered with Win95, spending hours drawing in MS Paint, using a mouse with a rolling ball that can be taken out from the bottom. Yes, the memory is still quite vivid. I have always loved art and design as a little girl, but later I set out on a journey where they fade out of the focal point.
              <br><br>
              I didn’t choose science because every kid in China is always told “if you got good grades, you need to be a scientist or engineer”, but because I liked analyzing and solving real problems, and believed that’s what changes people’s lives. So I went ahead to study Biomedical, Chemical and Nanotechnology Engineering. It was a rewarding journey full of excitements and challenges that equipped me with critical thinking and problem-solving skills, whereas I always felt distanced from those I meant to help. On the parallel side of it, I became enthusiastic about the ever-evolving technology that drastically changed lives around me. And I also noticed how the lacking of a user-friendly technological solution can negatively impact the effectiveness of a process or even the development of a business. I was deeply worried, but I couldn’t come up with an answer until I discover the hidden path of UX design right beside me. And, it was time to make a serious change.
              <br><br>
              I knew that making a career change takes serious commitment, so I enrolled in an immersive UX design apprentice program from Bloc.io, working on projects to learn how to link my passion with the skills I developed in the past to become an effective problem solver, keeping practicing empathy and studying front-end development skills. Designing a good user experience is not only producing pleasant artifacts, but also analyzing and tailoring the chemistry between product and its users. With that in mind, I’m always ready to keep pushing boundaries and make a difference.
