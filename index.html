              <span>I’m a Product Designer with a background in engineering and a deep commitment to human-centered design. My unconventional path—from scientific research to product design—taught me to approach challenges with analytical rigor while staying adaptable, a mindset that fuels continuous learning and growth.
              </span>
              <div class="sub-title">Crafting impactful experiences</div>
              <span>Over the past seven years, I’ve designed and launched intuitive digital products across diverse industries, bringing creativity, technology, and business needs into alignment. I see design not as a static discipline, but as a process of constant discovery.
              </span>
              <div class="sub-title">My design philosophy</div>
              <span>Leveraging AI as a mindset has become central to my practice—it extends creativity, accelerates exploration, and helps uncover new possibilities. For me, great design is about more than delivering seamless experiences; it’s about empowering teams to think differently and creating solutions that genuinely improve people’s lives.
