            <h2>competitive analysis</h2>
          </div>
          <p>There were two categories of competitors put under the microscope for the competitive analysis. One is general storage services such as DropBox, Google Drive and Box; the other focuses on note taking, EverNote.</p>
          <div class="competitor_wrap">
            <img src="/images/project1/logo_db.png" alt="dropbox logo"/>
            <img src="/images/project1/logo_gd.png" alt="google drive logo"/>
            <img src="/images/project1/logo_box.png" alt="box logo"/>
            <img src="/images/project1/logo_en.png" alt="evernote logo"/>
          </div>
          <p>By analyzing the competitors’ strength and weakness, it was discovered that even with these big names in the market there are still needs for an application that integrates quick note-taking feature with cloud storage functionality. Also, the fact that sharing, although is made easier using links than through emails, is still limited to single element sharing across the market. A feature that enables a more flexible sharing method could make our product stand out based on users’ growing needs for online collaborations.</p>

            <h2>user research</h2>

          <p>Bearing the assumptions from the competitive analysis, I conducted a user survey to fnd out their goals, attitudes, and more importantly, complains of using cloud storage service.</p>

      <section class="ideation">
        <p>After sketching out the wireframes for these user flows, I used Balsamiq to create low fidelity wireframes for usability testing. The focus in this step is on-boarding process and dashboard navigation. Some valuable feedback was collected regarding the order of the sign up steps and the layout of the note editing screen:</p>
        <div class="wf__question">
          <p>“I prefer to get to the dashboard right away instead of setting up my account now.”
            <br>“I don’t think I need this menu here and it’s taking up the editing space.”
            <br>“I’m not sure if my note is saved or not.”
            <br>“How do I get back to the dashboard?”
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>By analyzing the issues users came across during testing, I simplified the sign up process and improved the affordance layout of the editing screen. Additionally, from my observation, I also noticed that almost all users preferred to move things by dragging, like an instinct. So it inspired me to add a feature for users to edit content by dragging too. And it eventually became the Drawer tool that users liked a lot in the later usability testing.</p>

        <h1 id="prot_h1">prototyping <br> & <br> testing</h1>
        <p>Using Sketch, several main screens were mocked up, then connected into clickable prototypes for usability testing in InVision and UsabilityHub. <br>With this first version of prototype, I conducted several remote, in-person and online testing, where the user was asked to do three tasks: </p>
        <ul class="tasks">
          <li>Sign-up then get to the dashboard.</li>
          <li>Create a Note and add content.</li>
          <li>Create a Jar then share it. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After a few set of the testing I collected some vevy valuable feedback and iterated on several main aspects:</p>
        <ul class="feedback">
          <li><b>Most users didn’t notice that the setup mobile step can be skipped. </b>
            <br>Frustration was observed because users went through the process thinking it was a required step for first-time login, while trying to get to the dashboard right away. The problem was that the affordance for skipping the step and the information of this setup can be done later was not provided clearly.
            <img class="mob-hide" src="/images/project1/mob-hide/img_feedback1.png" alt="an image showing the identified problems"/>
          </li>
          <li><b>Users were confused on some CTA buttons.</b>
            <br>From my observation and the clicking heatmap, I noticed that users had trouble identifying some CTA buttons on the dashboard for creating new documents because of the color and size of the icon. Consistency is very important for users to navigate the app interface without any confusions.
            <img class="mob-hide" src="/images/project1/mob-hide/img_feedback2.png" alt="an image showing the identified problems"/>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Finding the Drawer tool in the Note editing screen took most users a long time. </strong>
            <br>For the ones that located it, they commented that “If it was not for the hint, I will never find it.” It was apparent that neither the Drawer itself nor the hint was able to attract users attention. To improve on that, I decided to keep Drawer open as its default status. Include instructions on how to user the Drawer in the hint to make it more useful for first-time users.
            <img class="mob-hide" src="/images/project1/mob-hide/img_feedback3.png" alt="an image showing the identified problems"/>
          </li>
            <li><b>Usability of the Jar tool can be improved. </b>
              <br>Most users showed interests in the way of sharing multiple things in the Jar tool, and considered the task easy to complete. However, they raised questions of the scalability, being that the box for users to locate items had a layered structure and it will get very hard to navigate once the layers of folder increased. It inspired me to include a search bar, which takes the full advantage of the smart tag feature of the product and further simplifies the sharing process.

        <p>It was a rewarding journey from the initial exploring to prototyping the final product.
          <br>Although there are a lot of great products out there that have excellent features and a large user base, there is always room for improvement by discovering user’s needs and pains. In the last round of the usability testing, users liked the idea of HIVE being a handy tool for collecting and creating content. Some said they would like to use it with family and friends for sharing recipes, planning trips or organizing events.
        </p>
        <p><b>More things to do</b>
          <br>However HIVE is far from being perfect, for example, I would like to collect more survey results and conduct more user testing for each round of iteration, a task-based tutorial will be useful to introduce the unique features to first-time users, the commenting feature could be mocked up in further detail for more user testing on the flow.

          <h2>key learnings</h2>
        </div>
        <p>As the project grew, I learned a lot through the process and became a better designer in many areas. And as the product itself, there is always room for improvement. Here is a short list of the key reflections to keep in mind in the next project.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Having an unbiased sample pool is crucial for product positioning and determining the trend of user needs. </b>
            <br>Having an unbiased sample pool is crucial for product positioning and determining the trend of user needs.
          </li>
          <li><b>Consistency is crucial. </b>
            <br>Keeping consistent in all types of elements across the application is important not only for branding and pleasant visuals, but also for a fluent navigation no matter what platform users are on.
          </li>
          <li><b>Iteration is more effective when changes are made based on the patterns in user feedback.  </b>
            <br>People have different opinions toward a design, sometimes they can be quite strong too. Ask, observe, write them down, pool everything together before letting the eager of correcting for negative feedback take control.
          </li>
        </ul>
